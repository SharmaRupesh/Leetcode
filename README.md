# Leetcode
I have added a collection of Leetcode problems solutions here in Java. It comprises of many easy, medium, hard problems mixed all together some are from the problemsets and some are from challenges. Although the solutions may or may not be 100% optimal but may be used to get an understanding of code because they are well structured and kept as simple as possible.
